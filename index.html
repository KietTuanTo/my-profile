            <h2>Who is Tyler the Creator?</h2>
            <p>Tyler, the Creator was born as Tyler Gregory 
                Okonma in Los Angeles, California on March 6, 1991. 
                He was raised by his mother in the Ladera Heights 
                and Hawthorne Heights sections of L.A. Growing up 
                Tyler, the Creator taught himself how to play the 
                piano and would design his own album covers for 
                existing albums.</p>

            <h2>What is IGOR</h2>
            <p>The overall story of Tyler, the Creator's newest album, 
                IGOR, is something many have lived through. You fall 
                for someone. They reciprocate but refuse to go all-in. 
                So you exist in limbo, waiting on them to bring you 
                heaven or send you to hell. Consumed by the lack of 
                closure: you wallow, you hurt, you rage. But. 
                Eventually. You come to your senses and move on.</p>

            <h2>What is Running Out of Time?</h2>
            <p>“RUNNING OUT OF TIME” describes Tyler’s fleeting 
                relationship with a significant other and warn 
                them that a split is imminent. Thematically, it
                 introduces tension to the love dynamic previously 
                 constructed throughout the album. During Tyler’s 
                 Apple Music Concert in L.A, he explained that he 
                 showed the album to Kendrick Lamar, where Kendrick
                  praised him about the raw feeling of the album and 
                  his overall willingness to ‘sing his truth’. This 
                  conversation led him to write this song.</p>
